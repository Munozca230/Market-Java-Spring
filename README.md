# Market-Java-Spring
The project is a Java Spring Boot 3.0 API for a market that features a complete CRUD system to interact with its database. Additionally, the API utilizes Spring Security JWT for user authentication and authorization.

The API allows for operations such as adding products to the inventory, updating product information, obtaining sales information, and other similar operations. Users must authenticate using a JWT token to access protected endpoints.

The implementation of Spring Security JWT ensures data protection and API security by generating access tokens for authenticated users. The entire project is complete and ready to be used in production.
